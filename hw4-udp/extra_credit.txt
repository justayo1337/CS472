 - Sequence number validation.
    - Compared the seqNum in the ACK from the server with the updated seqNum on the client/sender side
    - Send back a packet with the error code 'DP_ERROR_BAD_SEQNUM' defined in the du-proto.h
    - Need to implement a way to resend the packets in the situation that the seqNum is wrong, and also need to implement a way to send just the needed data again and will require adding new mtypes for that
 - Timeout  for UDP socket
    - set the timeout option in the dplisten() and dpconnect() functions to only allow timing out after a connection has been established
    - There is now a check in dprecvraw() to retry 3 times when there is a timeout to receive and it finally exits when that happens the 4th timeout
    - Tried to implement a way to close both sides of the connection if there was a timeout the did not recover after 3 tries.
